1. "What is the purpose of the “Hello, World!” program?"
The "Hello, World!" program is classically the first program we ever create with any programming language. It's the simplest way we have
to see how a computer executes the instructions we give.

2. "Name the four parts of a function."
The four parts of a function are: 
1st - A return type (int, string...), that specifies what kind of result, the function will have when executed.
2nd - A name. (e.g. main).
3rd - A parameter list. Enclosed in parenthesis "()". 
4th - A function body. Enclosed in a set of curly braces, "{}". It lists the actions that the function is about to perform.

3. "Name a function that must appear in every C++ program."
The function that must appear in every C++ program is the function main.

4. "In the “Hello, World!” program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?"
The purpose of the line "return 0;" is to indicate that the program terminated successfully.

5. "What is the purpose of the compiler?"
The purpose of the compiler is to transform or translate C++ code into machine code to be read by the computer.

6. "What is the purpose of the #include directive?"
The #include directive, instructs the computer to make available facilities from a file (like the std_lib_facilities.h that we use)
or from a certain pre-defined module like <iostream>.

7. "What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?"
In C++, a ".h" suffix at the end of a file name means that we have a header file. A header file contains definitions such as "cout", 
that we so often use in our programs. 

8. "What does the linker do for your program?"
A linker is what connects our compiled code with the object code from the standard C++ library in order to create the executable program. 

9. "What is the difference between a source file and an object file?"
A source file is our human readable file, written in C++ or any other programming language. An object file, is the compiled
computer readable output.

10. "What is an IDE and what does it do for you?"
An IDE, is basically the "code editor" where we will write and compile our code.

11. "If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?"
Well, I guess practice is the only way to develop such a complex skill as coding.
